# How to Get Unbanned on Warface (2025 Guide) 🎯

Getting banned from Warface stings, especially when you’re pretty sure you weren’t up to no good. Don’t worry! This simple guide will help you figure out what went wrong, and how to appeal your ban like a pro to get back into the action ASAP.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Locked out even after making a fresh account? Or banned across all your accounts? You might have a **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Warface has blacklisted your PC hardware, so you can’t just create new accounts and expect to play.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or notifications from Warface or My.Games to find out the ban reason. Usual suspects include:
- Cheating or using unfair third-party tools  
- Toxic chat, harassment, or unsporting behavior  
- Account sharing, hacking, or suspicious login activity  

**Tip:** Always skim the Warface Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
